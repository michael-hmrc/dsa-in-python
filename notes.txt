Two-pointer techniques
Sliding window techniques
String manipulation and parsing

Single linked list
Doubly linked list
Circular linked list
Operations (insertion, deletion, reversal)
Stacks and Queues

Implementation using arrays and linked lists
Common operations
Applications (e.g., expression evaluation, backtracking)
Hash Tables

Implementation concepts (hash functions, handling collisions)
Operations (insert, delete, search)
Applications (e.g., counting frequencies, caching)
Trees

Binary trees
Binary search trees (BST)
AVL trees, Red-Black trees
