Singly Linked List
---------------------------------------------

They consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient insertions and deletions.

Types of Linked Lists
---------------------------------------------

- Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node in the list.
- Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.
- Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

Basic Operations on a Singly Linked List
---------------------------------------------
- Insertion: Add a new node to the list.
- Deletion: Remove a node from the list.
- Traversal: Navigate through the list to access or update nodes.
- Search: Find a node with a given value.
